I'm Kamila and I'm currently a PhD student at Université libre de Bruxelles. In my research I work on reduced-order modeling of turbulent reactive flows.

I also develop [**Science Docs**](https://kamilazdybal.github.io/science-docs/), a site with projects, tutorials and study notes for curious minds!

> My research is supported by the F.R.S.-FNRS Aspirant Research Fellow grant.
